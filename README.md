# Project-Gallery
Create a project gallery page that showcases my projects. The page will have a section or card for each project, with a title, an image, and a description. Use flexbox to arrange the cards on the page, and resize them based on screen width. The gallery should adapt its layout when the browser window resizes, and display the cards in a single column on mobile devices. Each card should also have a clickable button that opens and closes the description text.
